The next step of the program is to improve on that model by making it more efficient for prime counting function.

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every single composite number is a product of powers of prime numbers.
With that, I can improve the algorithm further by creating a list of prime numbers and test every single number based on (next line)
the list of prime numbers with the method stated in Research 1.
We can start with [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13] and set the prime counter to 6 since 13 is the sixth prime number.
Then for every single odd number (even number is not necessary since all even numbers except 2 are composite), we can use the (next line)
list to find out what numbers are prime, append them to the list, and simply check the 10001st element of the list.
